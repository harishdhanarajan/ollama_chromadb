Utilized the LangChain library to develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) algorithm leveraging a directory of unstructured data. By integrating Ollama, Nomic-Embed-Text, and Mistral 7B models, I enhanced the algorithm's ability to process and retrieve relevant information. Ollama facilitated the management of large datasets, while Nomic-Embed-Text provided robust text embeddings to improve semantic understanding. Mistral 7B, with its advanced natural language processing capabilities, significantly boosted the generation quality. This multi-model approach within LangChain proved effective in creating a sophisticated, responsive RAG system, demonstrating notable improvements in information retrieval and response accuracy.
